            <h3>Credit Unions Increasingly Turn to AI-Powered Fraud Tools as Attacks Grow More Sophisticated</h3>
            <p>Industry analysts report rising adoption of machine-learning fraud platforms across credit unions.</p>
            <div class="article-body">
              <p>AI-powered fraud prevention tools are gaining momentum among credit unions as card-not-present attacks and account-takeover attempts grow more sophisticated. Vendors now offer behavior-based scoring, anomaly detection, and real-time decisioning — capabilities previously accessible only to large banks.</p>
              <p>Credit unions are adopting these tools to reduce manual reviews, catch high-velocity fraud patterns, and minimize false declines. Analysts say the shift reflects a broader financial-services trend: fraudsters increasingly use automation and AI themselves, forcing institutions to update their defenses.</p>
              <p>Early adopters report improvements in accuracy and fewer member complaints about blocked transactions, though results vary by vendor and implementation.</p>

            <h3>AI Chat and Virtual Assistants Gain Traction in Credit Union Digital Strategies</h3>
            <p>More credit unions are deploying conversational AI to reduce call-center volume and improve member self-service.</p>
            <div class="article-body">
              <p>Conversational AI tools — including virtual assistants, intelligent chat, and guided workflows — are becoming core components of digital-transformation roadmaps at many credit unions. These tools help members complete tasks like card replacement, account inquiries, loan payment questions, and branch information without waiting on hold.</p>
              <p>Industry research shows that younger members increasingly prefer chat-based interactions for simple requests, and credit unions are responding by integrating AI into both digital banking and website channels.</p>
              <p>While the technology is not perfect, leaders report that virtual assistants reduce friction and free up contact center teams to focus on complex issues that require human attention.</p>

            <div class="article-body">
              <p>Several core banking vendors serving credit unions have introduced AI-powered modules to help institutions modernize without large in-house data science teams.</p>

            <h3>More Credit Unions Explore AI Governance as Board Expectations Rise</h3>
            <p>Boards are increasingly asking leadership teams how AI is being used — and controlled.</p>

              <p>Credit union boards are beginning to request clearer explanations of where AI is deployed across the institution, how models are evaluated, and how member data is being used. This is prompting many CUs to develop simple AI governance frameworks and prepare internal “model inventories.”</p>
              <p>The goal isn’t full regulatory compliance — it’s clarity. Boards want confidence that leadership understands the technology and its risks.</p>
              <p>Consultants say this trend mirrors what happened with cybersecurity several years ago: oversight is becoming a standard expectation.</p>

              <p>AI-generated call summaries — now available through several contact-center platforms — are reducing after-call work for credit union agents. Instead of typing long narratives, staff receive an auto-generated summary of each interaction, including intent, resolution steps, and follow-ups.</p>
              <p>This shift helps contact centers improve consistency and reduce errors in documentation, while freeing agents to move to the next call sooner.</p>

            <h3>NCUA Launches New AI Resource Center to Guide Credit Unions on Responsible Adoption</h3>
            <p>The NCUA released a new online hub providing guidance, education, and best-practice considerations for credit unions evaluating artificial intelligence solutions.</p>
            <div class="article-body">
              <p>The National Credit Union Administration has launched an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Resource Center, giving credit unions a centralized place to learn about regulatory expectations, model governance, vendor oversight, and emerging risks associated with AI adoption.</p>
              <p>In its announcement, the NCUA said the resource center is designed to help credit unions “adopt AI in a safe, fair, and responsible manner.” The agency emphasized that most credit unions will not build AI models internally but will instead rely on vendors — making oversight and explainability essential.</p>
              <p>“While AI can deliver benefits to both institutions and consumers, credit unions need to ensure these tools are used responsibly and align with consumer protection laws,” said NCUA Chairman Todd Harper.</p>
              <p>Industry experts say this move signals that regulators are preparing for broader AI adoption across credit unions while maintaining consumer protection standards.</p>

Dozens of credit unions have joined the network in the past year, reflecting rising member demand for instant transfers and real-time balances.</p>
              <p>A Federal Reserve spokesperson noted that participation continues to increase across institutions of all sizes. Credit unions adopting FedNow typically start with member-to-member transfers and internal transfers, with plans to roll out business payments later.</p>
              <p>FedNow is expected to influence digital-banking UX expectations, making real-time movement of money feel like a standard rather than a premium service.</p>
