        <div class="article-body">
          <p>Velocity Community Credit Union has adopted Point Predictive’s AutoPass solution to strengthen fraud detection across identity theft, synthetic identities, income and employment misrepresentation, credit washing, and bust-out schemes, according to Finopotamus. <a class="link" href="https://www.finopotamus.com/post/velocity-community-credit-union-adopts-point-predictive-s-autopass-to-combat-all-forms-of-fraud?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finopotamus →</a></p>
          <p>The announcement is notable because it reflects a pragmatic, credit-union-level AI deployment. Rather than a broad AI transformation narrative, it is a targeted move focused on one of the highest-impact areas for lenders: preventing fraud losses while maintaining lending velocity.</p>
          <p>Synthetic identity fraud, in particular, has become a persistent challenge across financial services. Fraudsters can create identities that look legitimate across multiple signals, and traditional rules often struggle to detect them without creating false positives that slow down legitimate members.</p>
          <p>Tools like AutoPass are typically positioned to add more signal to early-stage decisioning and verification. For credit unions, this category of AI adoption tends to show value when it is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Integrated into the workflow:</strong> The value comes from catching risk at the point of decision, not after loss events.</li>
            <li><strong>Tuned to portfolio reality:</strong> Fraud patterns differ by geography, product, and member base. Teams need visibility into what the model is flagging and why.</li>
            <li><strong>Measured with clear outcomes:</strong> Detection rate, false positives, manual review volume, and loss reduction should be tracked consistently.</li>
            <li><strong>Paired with member experience:</strong> Fraud prevention is not just a risk issue. It can also increase friction. Credit unions need to balance protection with a smooth lending and onboarding experience.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This is also a reminder that AI adoption in credit unions often shows up first in risk and fraud, where the economics are straightforward and the ROI story is easy to defend.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:16px;"><strong>Credit union impact</strong><br>Fraud-focused AI deployments are becoming a near-term priority for credit unions. This is a clear example of a credit union implementing AI to reduce losses and protect members without waiting for a broader transformation program.</p>
