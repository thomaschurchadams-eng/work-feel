        <h1>Posh introduces “AI Operating Procedures” to bring agentic reasoning into regulated banking workflows</h1>
        <p class="article-date">December 2025</p>
        <div class="article-tags">
          <span class="tag">Reporting</span><span class="tag">Agentic AI</span><span class="tag">Automation</span><span class="tag">Operations</span><span class="tag">Governance</span>
        </div>
        <p class="article-summary">Posh outlined a structured approach to agentic AI it calls AI Operating Procedures, aiming to pair more capable automation with controls suited to regulated banking environments.</p>
        <div class="article-body">
          <p>The core tension Posh is trying to address is familiar across financial services. Leaders want AI to take meaningful action, not just answer questions, but they also need the system to behave predictably, respect policy, and leave an auditable trail. Posh’s pitch is that operating procedures can provide a structured method for defining what AI is allowed to do, how it should do it, and what guardrails apply.</p>
          <p>While the announcement is positioned for banks broadly, the concept lands in a very credit-union-shaped place: automation that touches member experience and back office workflows. Member-facing chat and assisted service are often where AI appears first. From there, institutions move into workflow automation like case routing, intake, dispute triage, card servicing, and loan processing.</p>
          <p>For credit union leaders, the practical question is less about labels and more about operating discipline. If an AI system is allowed to take actions, even limited actions, you need clarity on three things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Control surface:</strong> What decisions can the AI make, and what decisions must remain human? Clear definitions are the difference between safe automation and accidental policy violations.</li>
            <li><strong>Oversight and auditability:</strong> If a member complaint or exam question arises, you need to show what the system did, why it did it, and what data it used.</li>
            <li><strong>Change management:</strong> Agentic systems can drift as prompts, policies, or upstream models change. Institutions need a process to test and re-validate behavior over time.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Posh’s framing suggests the market is moving from one-off AI use cases toward repeatable operating models. That shift matters for credit unions evaluating vendor solutions. It is a signal to ask vendors not just “what can it do,” but “how do we control it, monitor it, and prove it.”</p>
          <p>Posh says it has introduced a new approach to deploying agentic AI in banking, framed as “AI Operating Procedures.” The announcement positions these operating procedures as a way to make AI systems more capable and autonomous while still staying aligned to the controls and constraints required in regulated environments. <a class="link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251217646720/en/How-Poshs-AI-Operating-Procedures-Redefine-Banking-Automation-with-Agentic-Reasoning?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Wire →</a></p>

          <p style="margin-top:16px;"><strong>Credit union impact</strong><br>Agentic AI is moving from demo to deployment. Credit unions should expect vendor conversations to shift from chat features to controlled workflows, with more emphasis on policy, monitoring, and audit trails.</p>
