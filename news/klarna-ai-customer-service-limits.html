        <p class="article-summary">A Reuters report describes companies recalibrating customer service AI claims, noting that complex member issues still require human agents.</p>
        <div class="article-body">
          <p>A Reuters report highlights a more measured view of enterprise AI adoption, including examples where companies have dialed back ambitious claims as real-world performance meets real-world complexity. One example in the report is Klarna, where leadership acknowledged that while AI can handle simple tasks reliably, more complex issues often still need to move to human agents. <a class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/business-leaders-agree-ai-is-future-they-just-wish-it-worked-right-now-2025-12-16/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters →</a></p>
          <p>This is an important reality check for financial institutions experimenting with AI in member service. Many early AI deployments focus on deflection: answering simple questions, routing requests, and handling routine tasks. Those can deliver immediate operational wins. But as soon as the interaction becomes emotionally charged, policy-sensitive, or multi-step, the AI needs escalation paths and guardrails.</p>
          <p>For credit unions, the lesson is not “AI does not work.” It is “AI works best when designed as part of a system.”</p>
          <p>That system typically includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Narrow first mile use cases:</strong> Balance inquiries, basic account questions, password resets, and simple status updates are often safe starting points.</li>
            <li><strong>Strong handoff design:</strong> AI must hand off to human support quickly, with context, so members do not repeat themselves.</li>
            <li><strong>Clear limits and monitoring:</strong> When members are frustrated, they will test the system’s boundaries. Institutions need monitoring for failure modes and customer friction.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> The first version is rarely the final version. Teams need feedback loops to refine workflows.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Reuters also noted that some firms are working on “second-generation” chatbots and more advanced AI approaches while maintaining a significant human component. That hybrid reality is likely to be the dominant model in credit unions for the near term.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:16px;"><strong>Credit union impact</strong><br>Credit unions can capture real value from AI in member service, but the strongest outcomes come from focused use cases, reliable escalation, and ongoing monitoring. AI should reduce friction, not create new frustration.</p>
